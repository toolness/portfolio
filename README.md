## Quick Start

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080/.

## Deploying

Run `npm run build`, then copy the `dist` directory to a web server.

`npm run s3` can be used to deploy directly to S3; just make sure
the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables are set.
