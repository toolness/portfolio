In early 2009, building a Firefox add-on was hard: multiple files using
obscure formatting rules had to be written, and silently failed if a single
unfortunate typo was made. Debugging information was scarce, and changing the
behavior of the add-on required restarting all of Firefox.

Jetpack attempted to change this by making both the development cycle and the
installation process restartless. Clean APIs with interactive tutorials
embedded in their documentation allowed users to tinker with code and
instantly see the results in their browser chrome.

The original prototype was built in collaboration with [Aza Raskin][];
the project eventually went on to become the [Add-on SDK][].
