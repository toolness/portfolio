It all started with a blog post called [Kids and The Open Web][]: as a 
public resource accessible to all, everyone--including kids--benefits from
understanding the very basics of how it works. This led to the creation
of a tool called [Web X-Ray Goggles][], which lets anyone with basic computer
skills peer underneath the surface of any Web page, tinker with it, 
and share their changes. The tool was originally embodied in a kid
and family-friendly program called Hackasaurus.

Hackasaurus was designed in collaboration with [Jess Klein][] and featured
in [The Atlantic][].
