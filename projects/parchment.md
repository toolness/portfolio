In 2008, experiencing Interactive Fiction required downloading a native app
and a story file and loading one in the other. However, the Web was advanced
enough that it should be possible to experience the entirety of a work simply
by visiting a Web page. So I repurposed [Gnusto][], a Z-Machine interpreter
embedded in a Firefox extension, and encased it in a new Web-based shell with 
beautiful typography.

The result is called [Parchment][].
