Game Jams are events in which small teams of individuals create tiny games
over a short period of time. Unfortunately, it can be hard for newcomers to
make their first game; it can also be difficult to showcase the final output
of the event.

Minicade attempts to solve these problems by allowing anyone to use their Web-
based tool of choice to create their game and add it to a "playlist" of mini-
games that can be played as one giant game. Additionally, it consists of the
Minigame Maker, which is a mobile-friendly way to create such games using a
simple block-based visual programming language, and subsequently "level up" by
examining the generated HTML5 source code of their game and tinkering with it.

Minicade was designed in collaboration with [Chloe Varelidi][] and 
described as a tool that "sparked our inner mallrat arcade fiend" by
[Paper magazine][].
