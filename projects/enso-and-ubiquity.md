At [Humanized][], our four-person team designed a product called *Enso* which
built on the ideas of human-computer interface expert Jef Raskin to augment a
desktop GUI by making it both easier to learn *and* more efficient to use. It
was released in 2007 to positive reviews from [The Wall Street Journal][wsj]
and [37 Signals][].

In 2008, at Mozilla Labs, we created a cousin to Enso called
*Ubiquity*, which aimed to do the same thing for browsers.
