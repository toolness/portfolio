While reading Eli Pariser's "The Filter Bubble", I was alarmed by how many
tracking services were watching the entirety of my behavior on the Web. As
a way to help myself and others understand it, I created a tool to
visualize who was watching us as we browse the Web, with the belief that
transparency could lead to a better world.

Collusion became the centerpiece for a [TED Talk][] given by the CEO of
Mozilla and went on to receive a grant from the Ford Foundation. It is
now known as [Lightbeam][].
